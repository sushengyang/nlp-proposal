In some cases, stars that are given to hotels (location, rooms, service, value etc.)  can be used to compare the reviews and the rating of hotels. 

####Steps
* Getting hotel reviews from web
* Data processing (cleaning, solving Turkish chracter problems)
* Training the data
* Testing & Improving the training data iteratively
* Data Visualization with [Google Geochart](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geochart)
