## NLP - Sentiment Analysis Project 
###Social Emotion
###Existing Methods
In sentiment analysis the existing methods can be grouped into four main categories: 
* Keyword spotting 
* Lexical affinity 
* Statistical methods 
* Concept-level techniques. 

###Proposal
The purpose of this project is getting data from social websites such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Facebok](https://facebook.com/) and determining feelings of people with sentiment analysis methods. In social world, determining how people are feeling is not easy but emojis may help for this purpose. That's why emojis one of the techniques that i'm planning to use.
